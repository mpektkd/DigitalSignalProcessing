## Task 2

  - **Part 1:** _Calculation of Short-Time Energy and Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) in motion and heart rate signals_
    - By calculating the short time energies and STFT of the (acc, gyr, hrm) compontents, we define the characteristics of a signal (mean, min, max, standard deviation)
    - By comparing signals of "sleep" and "step", we conclude that what distinguishes a sleeping from an awake person is the:
      1.  standard deviationmin
      2.  min
      3.  max
    - Conclusions:
      - If a person's heart rate has high maximums and low minimums, as well as high standard deviation, then the person is awake.
